# How to Duplicate this project

1. Follow the instruction to enable Google Sheet API [here](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/js).
2. For the starter purpose, you can duplicate my base Google Spreadsheet contents [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XoZlWRD2REeytJoBbw9f-I0mCU2HilrmMLyl9w0gPFU/edit?usp=drive_link).
3. You also can clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/yehezkielgunawan/link-collection.git`.
4. Run `pnpm install` to install all the deps that needed.
5. I assume you've got your own API key by following the first step, you can copy it to the env variables. I've set the `.env.example` files here.
6. Run `pnpm dev` to serve the web from the local device.
